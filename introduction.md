# Introduction to Kotlin

---

[Kotlin][kotlin] is a modern open-source programming language.
It gives various opportunities to create powerful apps for multiple purposes:
cross-platform mobile, desktop, and full-stack web apps, frameworks, and libraries.

## Why Kotlin

Kotlin has several benefits that distinguish it from other programming languages.

* Kotlin syntax is **concise and simple**, which makes your code compact and easy to read and maintain.
* Kotlin supports **multiplatform** programming.
    It means you can have a single code base for Android, iOS, and web apps
    without losing their performance.
    Moreover, multiplatform programming can reduce development time and costs significantly.
* Kotlin is fully **interoperable** with Java which allows embedding your Kotlin code to Java and vice versa.
    Also, you can access all Java frameworks and libraries in your Kotlin apps without any limitations.
* Kotlin provides a high level of **safety** and helps you avoid common programming mistakes.

## What and who Kotlin is for

Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for development in many areas.
Creating financial web platforms and cross-platform mobile apps, building efficient embedded systems,
and developing enterprise-level frameworks — all this and even more can be done using Kotlin.

Kotlin is a fast-growing language: top companies, universities, and small businesses choose Kotlin for achieving their goals.
Moreover, Kotlin has a solid and welcoming community that is ready to help and discuss any problem.

You can find more information about Kotlin and its real-life usage on the [Kotlin forums][forum],
[Stack Overflow][so], and [Kotlin Slack][slack].

## How to start

If you are new to programming or want to know more about Kotlin fundamentals,
you can refer to [Kotlin learning materials][learning-materials].
We also recommend starting with the following:

* Free [Kotlin Basics track][kotlin-basics] on JetBrains Academy.
    This track will guide you through the programming and Kotlin essentials.
    You will not only get the theoretical knowledge but will also use new skills to complete your projects.
* [Atomic Kotlin book][atomic-kotlin] which breaks Kotlin concepts into “atoms”.
    This book also provides you with various exercises and describes solutions to them.

If you already have an idea of what app you want to create, we suggest following the steps below.
